[Insidr](https://insidrmusic.com/) is the open source Spotify-meets-Patreon music streaming platform.

## How does Insidr work for music artists?

1. **Fans subscribe to you** - Your fans - your _Insidrs_ - pay a monthly subscription price that you as the artist sets

2. **Fans stream your unreleased music** - Your Insidrs now get access to stream your released and unreleased music

3. **Fans engage with your content** - Your Insidrs now get access to stream your released and unreleased music

4. **You, the artist, get paid** - Artists get paid every month. With Insidr, you'll earn 4000% more than you do on other music streaming platforms.
